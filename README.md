This is an API that can simulate several scenarios in the FPX UI.

It will create a bunch of routes, and then execute several requests that stress test the FPX ui a little.

To generate request data, run `npm run dev:ping`

You might need to configure this to connect to your own neon database. Feel free to remove or modify the `.neon` file.


## Basics

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

```
npm run deploy
```

```
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
```

## Configuring Neon

Install the neon CLI and follow this script (you'll need the `jq` command line utility). Alternatively, grab your connection string from the Neon dashboard and add it to a `.dev.vars` file in the root of the project under the key `DATABASE_URL`.

```sh
# Authenticate with neon cli
neonctl auth

# Create project if you haven't already
#
# > *skip this* if you already created a project,
# > and grab the DATABASE_URL from your dashboard
PROJECT_NAME=mizu-test-cases
neonctl projects create --name $PROJECT_NAME --set-context

# Set project id because the call to `set-context` below needs it
PROJECT_ID=$(neonctl projects list --output=json | jq --arg name "$PROJECT_NAME" '.projects[] | select(.name == $name) | .id')

# Create a `dev` db branch then set context
BRANCH_NAME=dev
neonctl branches create --name=$BRANCH_NAME
neonctl set-context --project-id=$PROJECT_ID --branch=$BRANCH_NAME

# Finally, add connection string to .dev.vars
DATABASE_URL=$(neonctl connection-string)
echo -e '\nDATABASE_URL='$DATABASE_URL'\n' >> .dev.vars
```

This will create a `.neon` file, which is used by the `neonctl` command to know the proper context for running commands. 

This file can be kept in version control. From [the Neon docs](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/cli-set-context):

> **Neon does not save any confidential information to the context file (for example, auth tokens).** You can safely commit this file to your repository or share with others.
